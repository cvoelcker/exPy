# exPy - Experimentation framework for machine learning setups

Machine learning setups require a lot of experimentation with slight changes in code or parameters. This can lead to a lot of confusion, for example f you change two parameters between different runs and want to check an old configuration again, but didn't properly commit every step of the way into your github repo.

This framework is designed to help with the management, saving and loading of machine learning setups in an intuitive, low overhead way.
